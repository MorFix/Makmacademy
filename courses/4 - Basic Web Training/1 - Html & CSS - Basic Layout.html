<p>After having a basic understanding of the browser&#39;s layout process, write a basic html file for a basic page layout.
The page will be separated into three components, toolbar, navigation panel and a content, each represented with a colored div. </p>
<p>The content should contain a large amount of elements inside to trigger a scroll, the scroll should be only on the content part and will not scroll away the toolbar and navigation panel.
The page will look like this:</p>
<p><img src="assets/web/ex1/ex1.png" width="800" /></p>
<p>Notes:</p>
<ul>
<li>CSS will be placed in a separate stylesheet and linked to the HTML file</li>
<li>CSS classes will be named in the kebab-case format</li>
<li>Play around with the Chrome DevTools and try to mess around with your element&#39;s css in the DevTools</li>
</ul>
