<p>At this point you might be wondering what is the point in having a mail client if it doesn‚Äôt do anything?
Why would anyone want a page that does nothing?</p>
<p>What is the meaning of life?! ü§îü§î</p>
<p>Well‚Ä¶ you are right, your application is useless right now.
In order to make your application actually do something, you&#39;ll need to learn JavaScript and for that, we&#39;ll put our mail project aside for now.</p>
<p>Before starting the exercise, do the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Go over codeacademy&#39;s JS course (No need to do every part, just have a basic understanding of the syntax).</li>
<li><a href="http://devdocs.io/javascript-array/">Array functions</a></li>
<li>Install Node</li>
<li>Install WebStorm</li>
</ul>

<p>This exercise will include DOM manipulation.</p>
<p>Your goal is to create an In-Browser Stopwatch application using HTML, CSS &amp; JS.
The UI will be simple ‚Äì</p>
<ul>
<li>a display part in the format of MM:SS:mmm</li>
<li>a control part with 2 buttons<ul>
<li>Start<ul>
<li>click will reset the stopwatch and will start updating the display</li>
<li>if the watch is running, the Start button should be disabled</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Stop<ul>
<li>click will stop the Stopwatch.</li>
<li>if the watch isn&#39;t running, the stop button should be disabled</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>NOTE</strong>: You will use native JS and DOM API.</p>
