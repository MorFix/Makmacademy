<h1 id="putting-it-all-together-webbit">Putting it all together – Webbit</h1>
<p>Congratulations! You are now at the final exercise, but this isn&#39;t over yet.</p>
<h2 id="part-1-basic-project">Part 1 - Basic Project</h2>
<p>In the first part of this exercise, you will receive an almost complete web app.
Your mission is to complete the app, and make it work.
Use best practices and design patterns to make sure the project runs correctly,
You will have to defend the entire code-base in a code review so make sure you
understand <b>every</b> line of code.</p>
<p>Explore the packages and concepts brought to you in the project:</p>
<ul>
<li>Babel</li>
<li>Webpack</li>
<li>Authentication</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="part-2-webbit">Part 2 - Webbit</h2>
<h2 id="1-main-concept">1.    Main Concept</h2>
<p>The site will be a user-provided content site resembling www.reddit.com.</p>
<p>The site will have infinite number of &quot;subwebbits&quot;, each dedicated for a subject (their name, will be unique).</p>
<p>Inside a subwebbit, users posts new threads. For simplicity, a thread&#39;s content will be text only. Users can comment on a thread and say whatever they want, users may also comment on these comments, but again, for simplicity, only root comments can have comments.</p>
<h2 id="2-detailed-requirements">2.    Detailed Requirements</h2>
<h3 id="2-1-subwebbit">2.1.    Subwebbit</h3>
<p>A subwebbit acts like a container for relevant threads. Every subwebbit is named for its subject (AskWebbit for questions to users, News for posting news etc…).</p>
<p>Every user can post and see inside every subwebbit, but only the owner (creator of the subwebbit) can delete threads inside the subwebbit.</p>
<p>When a user asks for a non-existing subwebbit, he will be given the opportunity to create the requested one and own it.</p>
<p>The owner may also delete the entire subwebbit, removing all threads inside.
When browsing a subwebbit, all threads will be ordered from new to old.</p>
<h3 id="2-2-thread">2.2.    Thread</h3>
<p>The basic unit of content is a thread. A thread consists of an author, subject, content (again, text only for simplicity), date of creation and rating.</p>
<p>The rating system will be the upvote/downvote system and will be specified later in this document.</p>
<h3 id="2-3-comment">2.3.    Comment</h3>
<p>Users may comment on a thread, providing information, expressing opinion and saying stupid things.
A comment consists of an author, content, date of creation and rating.</p>
<p>The rating system will be the same upvote/downvote system.</p>
<p>Inside a thread comments will be ordered according to their rating, from most rated to lowest.</p>
<p>A root comment is a comment for a thread. Root comments may have sub-comments on them, acting like regular comments. Sub-comments can&#39;t have comments to avoid complexity.</p>
<h3 id="2-4-user">2.4.    User</h3>
<p>People must register and login before they can enter the site. Users register with a username and a password.</p>
<p>A user has a list of subscribed subwebbits, upon registering this list will be initialized with the 10 most subscribed subwebbits so the user will start by enjoying the best content.</p>
<p>Like mentioned in the subwebbit section, a user can own subwebbits by creating them.</p>
<p>A user should be able to view his subscribed subwebbits - be it a page or anything out of your imagination.</p>
<h3 id="2-5-front-page">2.5.    Front Page</h3>
<p>The homepage will act like a subwebbit, but it will not be an actual one. Instead, it will show all threads from the user&#39;s subscribed subwebbits, ordered by rating.</p>
<p>In the front page users may not post new threads, instead they must go to their desired subwebbit and post there.</p>
<h3 id="2-6-rating-system">2.6.    Rating System</h3>
<p>Since our site is a user-provided content site, we need to provide users with a way of voting what content is good and what is bad. The rating system will be relatively simple – 
Every vote-able content will have two buttons:</p>
<ul>
<li>Upvote – Increases the content&#39;s rating by one.</li>
<li>Downvote – Decreases the content&#39;s rating by one, rating may be negative.</li>
</ul>
<p>A user may only vote once on every vote-able item, voting again removes the user&#39;s last vote.</p>
<h2 id="closing-notes">Closing Notes</h2>
<p>Take your time, make sure you truly understand every new concept that&#39;s introduced
both in server and client sides of the web app, and if you don&#39;t - then either
do your research or ask your trainer for further explanations.</p>
<p>Good luck!</p>
