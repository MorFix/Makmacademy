<p>Now we want to implement our serializers without the need to implement the <code>ISerializable</code> interface, to do that you will use the Reflection namespace.</p>
<p>The serializers will serialize the animals and will get their properties using the available reflection methods.</p>
<p>All animals will be serialized except for the the sharks who might bite someone during the serialization...
Find a way to mark it so the serializer will know to ignore them, remember, there are plenty of fish in the sea.</p>

<p>Write an application (WinForms) that will be able to:</p>
<ol>
<li>Load an assembly and display all its types</li>
<li>Create an instance of whichever type we ask</li>
<li>Set values to the fields of the instances we created</li>
<li>Invoke methods of the object and get their results back (you may assume the return values are only integers or strings)</li>
</ol>
