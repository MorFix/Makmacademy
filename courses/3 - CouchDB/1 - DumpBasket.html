<p>Before starting:</p>
<ul>
<li>Install Apache CouchDB</li>
<li>Make sure you have your preffered HTTP tool (Postman, cURL...)</li>
<li>Do the CouchDB tutorial in the manuals (available through Futon&#39;s manuals)</li>
</ul>
<p>After having a basic understanding of what Apache CouchDB is and how to communicate with it,
you will use it to create an online file share solution named DumpBasket.</p>
<p>All the data in our system is shared between everyone, permissions are not supported, we want to share everything!</p>
<p>The entire data will be saved inside a single CouchDB database and you will create a simple UI using a framework of your choice to allow directory browsing of the data.</p>
<p>DumpBasket will support two types of items - files and folders. </p>
<h2 id="file">File</h2>
<p>Our system only supports text files, files have a name and they must live in a folder.</p>
<h2 id="folder">Folder</h2>
<p>A folder is a container for files, it also has a name.</p>
