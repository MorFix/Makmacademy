  <h1 id="troubleshooting">Troubleshooting</h1>
<h3 id="always-commit">Always commit</h3>
<p>When you commit a change you can be certain you will never lose it. If you stash something and delete the stash you can
be sorry later. If you reset uncommitted changes you also might suffer.
But if you commit something. You can always find it later.</p>
<h3 id="reflog">Reflog</h3>
<p>The reflog is a great tool for going back in history. You can revert any change in the git tree. (undo branch reset,
commit, rebase, pull, etc..).
In order to go back in history open 2 git bashes:</p>
<p><img src="assets/git/BashButton.png" /></p>
<p>In the first one write:</p>
<pre><code>git reflog
</code></pre>
<p>And find the head position you want to go to, then write in the second bash (let&#39;s say for position 10 in the HEAD):</p>
<pre><code>git reset --hard HEAD@{10}
</code></pre>
<p><img src="assets/git/HardReset.png" /></p>
<p>In this example, I wanted to go back to when I commited &quot;fix(sidenav-unread): show number of unread chats ...&quot;.</p>
<p>Now you can refresh git extensions and see you went back in time!</p>
<p>Even this action it-self is revertable using the the same technique.</p>
