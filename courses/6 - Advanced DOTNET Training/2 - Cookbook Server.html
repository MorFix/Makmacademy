<p>Congratualtions, you wrote a client that doesn&#39;t do anything!</p>
<p>You will now replace the CookbookDatabase dll with an actual server and a SQLServer database.</p>
<p>The server will use either WebAPI or WCF, ask your guide which one you will use.</p>
<p>The server will implement all the methods provided by the CookbookDatabase.dll, but make sure you implement the methods in an appropriate way for your 
technology (i.e proper REST urls for WebAPI...).</p>
<p>Make sure authentication is done properly and that only logged on users can access the methods.</p>
